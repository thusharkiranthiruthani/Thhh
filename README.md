Hi ,

Today I received a call from my parent company (Euclid Innovation) saying Deloitte has informed them that the project is over and my services will not be required after my contract end date (28th of this month).

Last month when I reminded you about the permanent conversion, you had acknowledged it. Now my parent company is saying something completely different, so I need your confirmation on what the actual situation is — is the conversion happening, or does my work end on the 28th?

Thanks.
