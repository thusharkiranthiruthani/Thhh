Hi ,

I wanted to talk to you about red teaming opportunities. It has been more than five months, and apart from a small amount of web application testing work with Truist Bank and the limited external part of the City of San Jose project, I haven’t done any meaningful red teaming work here. This is not what I joined for, and I haven’t had any chance to work on full-scope or in-depth red team engagements.

If I had known earlier that the work would be so limited and that Deloitte might not have many full-scale red teaming projects, I would have planned my next steps much sooner instead of waiting for opportunities that never came.

I need to understand the actual situation now. Is Deloitte expecting any in-depth, full-scope red teaming projects in the near future, or are those opportunities limited? If these types of projects are not going to be available, please let me know so I can plan accordingly, including looking for roles where I can work on more advanced red teaming engagements.

Thanks.
Thanks.
